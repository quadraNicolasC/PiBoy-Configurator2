# PIBOY-CONFIGURATOR version 1.3.3

# Special Thanks

- __Richard Capewell__ for the Retropie Menu icon
- __DrBuns3n__ for having the patience to point out problems at start-up and offer relevant suggestions

# 1. Installation

## 1.1 SSH
  Connect on SSH to your Pi and type the following commands :
  
    cd /home/pi
    git clone https://github.com/Vilikt/PiBoy-Configurator2.git ./PiBoy-Configurator
    cd PiBoy-Configurator
    sudo python install.py

## 1.2 SFTP
  You may don't want to use SSH. So you can download the sources and upload the Piboy-Configurator folder on /home/pi with FileZilla, WinSCP or something else.
  Then turn on your Piboy and connect a keyboard. Once you are in EmulationStation, press F4 key to get in the command prompt. Then type the following commands :

    cd /home/pi/PiBoy-Configurator
    sudo python install.py

# 2. Updates


  Piboy-Configurator project maybe updated since your first install. Check your actual version on the top left corner in the menu.
  To make an update, go to the command prompt (see 1. Installation) and type the following commands :
  
      cd /home/pi/PiBoy-Configurator
      git pull

  You can also to it within the general menu (see 5.1).

# 3. Add your overlays


  Basically this project was designed to use with the overlay pack available on https://github.com/gallyg/zover4recalbox


  You can see that the pack contains two types of overlays: with CRT effect (grid) and without effect (clean).


  You will see later that you can select the type of overlay you want to use. Note that by default is "grid". Also if you don't want to use multiple types of overlay you can put everything in the default "grid" directory.


# 4. Edit your retroarch configurations files


  The installation script may created two file in each system configs foler : retroarch.cfg.lcd and retroarch.cfg.tv. Each one is a copy of the retroarch.cfg.
  All you need to do now is to edit retroarch.cfg.lcd with the configuration you want for the handheld mode and retroarch.cfg.tv for TV mode.
  
  There is an example with GB system.
  
  __/opt/retropie/configs/gb/retroarch.cfg.lcd__ :

    # Settings made here will only override settings in the global retroarch.cfg if placed above the #include line

    input_remapping_directory = "/opt/retropie/configs/gb/"

    custom_viewport_height = "480"

    input_overlay_enable = true
    input_overlay = "~/.config/retroarch/overlay/LCD/gb-dmg.cfg"
    input_overlay_opacity = 1.0
    input_overlay_scale = 1.0
    video_scale_integer = "true"


    gambatte_dark_filter_level = "0"
    gambatte_gb_bootloader = "enabled"
    gambatte_gb_colorization = "internal"

    gambatte_gbc_frontlight_position = "central"
    gambatte_mix_frames = "mix"
    gambatte_show_gb_link_settings = "disabled"
    gambatte_up_down_allowed = "disabled"
    #include "/opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch.cfg"
  
  
   /opt/retropie/configs/gb/retroarch.cfg.tv :
   
    # Settings made here will only override settings in the global retroarch.cfg if placed above the #include line

    input_remapping_directory = "/opt/retropie/configs/gb/"

    savefile_directory = "~/RetroPie/saves/gb/sram/"
    savestate_directory = "~/RetroPie/saves/gb/savestates/"

    input_overlay_enable = true
    input_overlay_opacity = 0.7
    input_overlay_scale = 1.0
    input_overlay = "~/.config/retroarch/overlay/TV/[overlay_style]/handhelds/gb_overlay.cfg"
    input_overlay_hide_in_menu = "false"
    aspect_ratio_index = "23"
    video_scale_integer = "false"

    video_message_pos_x = "0.220000"

    custom_viewport_x = "409"
    custom_viewport_y = "35"
    custom_viewport_width = "1102"
    custom_viewport_height = "1010"


    gambatte_dark_filter_level = "0"
    gambatte_gb_bootloader = "enabled"
    gambatte_gb_colorization = "internal"
    gambatte_gb_hwmode = "GB"
    gambatte_gb_internal_palette = "GB - DMG"
    gambatte_gbc_color_correction = "GBC only"
    gambatte_gbc_color_correction_mode = "accurate"
    gambatte_gbc_frontlight_position = "central"
    gambatte_mix_frames = "mix"
    gambatte_show_gb_link_settings = "disabled"
    gambatte_up_down_allowed = "disabled"
    #include "/opt/retropie/configs/all/retroarch.cfg"

On startup the autoconfig.py is executed and it replaces each retroarch.cfg file with the content of retroarch.cfg.lcd or retroarch.cfg.tv if you are plugged on HDMI or not.

***NOTE*** : "[overlay_style]" **must** be written this way. Indeed, the script will replace this with "grid" or "clean" depending on what you have configured (see 5.1).

# 5. PiBoy Configuration entry in Retropiemenu


  A new entry named "PiBoy Configuration" is created in RetropieMenu.
  If you select it you will go on the principal menu "General Settings" :
